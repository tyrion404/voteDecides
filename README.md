# voteDecides

## Ethereum contract on vote of contributers decides to spend the ether in right way.

Example of how this app can be useful:

- Assume you wish to support a project (oxygen concentrator machine maker). But you want to know how your money is spent, and if you believe it is being squandered, you should be able to vote on whether or not it should be spent.

-  You cannot decide on your own; all other investors have the opportunity to vote as well. Only a transaction will be made if more than 60% of voters agree that it should be spent.

- But why should you use Block-chain? In this case, the block chain assures that no one can change the vote transaction. And all of the votes remain the same.
